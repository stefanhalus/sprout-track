# Authentication and Authorization

## Overview

Sprout Track supports two authentication paths: PIN-based caretaker auth (for self-hosted/simple setups) and account-based email/password auth (for SaaS mode). Both produce JWT tokens. All API authorization flows through middleware wrappers in `app/api/utils/auth.ts`, with family-level data scoping as the foundational security principle.

## Authentication Paths

### 1. PIN-Based (Caretaker Auth)
Used for self-hosted deployments and families without accounts.

**Flow:**
1. User enters family slug + two-digit login ID + security PIN
2. `POST /api/auth` validates credentials against `Caretaker` table
3. Server returns JWT containing: caretaker ID, name, type, role, familyId, familySlug, authType (`CARETAKER` or `SYSTEM`), plus subscription metadata (`betaparticipant`, `trialEnds`, `planExpires`, `planType`) when the family has a linked account
4. Client stores JWT in `localStorage` as `authToken`

**System Caretaker (loginId '00'):**
- Auto-created per family when no regular caretakers exist
- Authenticated via the family's `Settings.securityPin`
- Once regular caretakers are configured, the system caretaker is automatically disabled (login is also denied when the family's `Settings.authType` is `CARETAKER`)
- Granted admin-level access (`withAdminAuth` allows system caretakers)

### 2. Account-Based (Email/Password Auth)
Used for SaaS mode with individual user accounts.

**Flow:**
1. User registers via `/api/accounts/register` (email, password, name)
2. Verification email sent; user verifies via `/api/accounts/verify`
3. Login via `/api/accounts/login` with email + password
4. Server returns JWT with `isAccountAuth: true`, accountId, accountEmail
5. On each request, server fetches fresh account + linked caretaker from database

**Key difference:** Account JWTs trigger a database lookup on every request to get current family/caretaker associations, since these can change after the JWT was issued (e.g., during initial family setup).

### 3. Setup Authentication
Token-based auth for invited users creating a new family:
- Admin creates setup invite via `/api/family/create-setup-link`
- `FamilySetup` record created with token, hashed password, expiration
- Invited user authenticates with token + password
- JWT includes `isSetupAuth: true` and `setupToken`
- Grants admin privileges for family creation only

## Token Architecture

### Access Token (JWT)
- Stored in `localStorage` as `authToken`
- Sent via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- Lifetime: `AUTH_LIFE` env var (default 1800 seconds / 30 minutes)
- Signed with `JWT_SECRET` env var
- Legacy fallback: if no Bearer token is present, a `caretakerId` cookie is accepted for backward compatibility (`getAuthenticatedUser` verifies the caretaker against the database)

### Refresh Token
- Stored as HTTP-only cookie (`refreshToken`)
- Lifetime: `REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFE` env var (default 604800 seconds / 7 days) — sliding window: a fresh refresh cookie is issued on each refresh, so it caps the maximum inactivity gap before re-login
- Signed with separate secret (JWT_SECRET + '-refresh')
- Endpoint: `POST /api/auth/refresh-token`
- Contains minimal claims: userId, authType, familyId, accountId, tokenType

### Token Blacklist
- In-memory `Map<string, number>` (token → expiry timestamp)
- Populated on logout via `invalidateToken()`
- Cleaned up hourly (removes expired entries)
- Checked on every authenticated request

## Auth Middleware Wrappers

Every API route uses one of these wrappers. They are defined in `app/api/utils/auth.ts`.

### `withAuth(handler)`
**Use when:** Any authenticated user should have access.
```typescript
export const GET = withAuth(async (req) => { ... });
```
- Verifies authentication only
- Does not pass auth context to handler
- Returns 401 if not authenticated

### `withAuthContext(handler)`
**Use when:** Handler needs to know who the user is and which family they belong to. This is the most commonly used wrapper.
```typescript
export const GET = withAuthContext(async (req, authContext) => {
  const { familyId, caretakerId, isSysAdmin } = authContext;
  // ...
});
```
- Passes `AuthResult` object to handler
- Handles special cases:
  - **Setup auth:** Extracts familyId from query params and validates it against the setup token via `setupTokenMayTarget()` (`app/api/utils/setup-token-scope.ts`): a token bound to a family requires an exact match; an unbound token may name a family only on `/api/setup/start`. Anything else fails closed with 403.
  - **System admin:** Extracts family context from URL path, query params, or referer header
- Returns 401 if not authenticated

### `withAdminAuth(handler)`
**Use when:** Only admins, system caretakers, or system administrators should access.
```typescript
export const DELETE = withAdminAuth(async (req) => { ... });
```
- Allows: `caretakerRole === 'ADMIN'`, system caretakers (loginId '00'), or `isSysAdmin`
- Returns 403 if authenticated but not admin
- Writes a metadata-only audit log entry (who/when/endpoint/status, no bodies) for every call — including denied 401/403 attempts — when `ENABLE_LOG=true`

### `withSysAdminAuth(handler)`
**Use when:** Only the system administrator should access (family manager operations).
- Requires `isSysAdmin: true` in JWT
- Returns 403 for all other users
- Also writes metadata-only audit log entries when `ENABLE_LOG=true`

### `withAccountOwner(handler)`
**Use when:** Only the account owner (or system admin) should access.
```typescript
export const PUT = withAccountOwner(async (req, authContext) => { ... });
```
- Requires `isAccountOwner: true` or `isSysAdmin: true`
- Passes auth context to handler

## AuthResult Interface

The `AuthResult` object passed to handlers by `withAuthContext`:

```typescript
interface AuthResult {
  authenticated: boolean;
  caretakerId?: string | null;  // Who is making the request
  caretakerType?: string | null; // parent, nanny, daycare, etc.
  caretakerRole?: string;       // USER or ADMIN
  familyId?: string | null;     // THE source of truth for data scoping
  familySlug?: string | null;   // URL slug for the family
  isSysAdmin?: boolean;         // System administrator flag
  isSetupAuth?: boolean;        // Setup token authentication
  setupToken?: string;          // Setup token (if setup auth)
  authType?: string;            // CARETAKER, SYSTEM, ACCOUNT, or SYSADMIN
  isAccountAuth?: boolean;      // Account-based authentication
  accountId?: string;           // Account ID (if account auth)
  accountEmail?: string;        // Account email
  isAccountOwner?: boolean;     // Account owns the family
  verified?: boolean;           // Email verified
  betaparticipant?: boolean;    // Beta participant (exempt from expiration)
  isExpired?: boolean;          // Account subscription expired (soft expiration)
  trialEnds?: string | null;    // Trial end date (ISO)
  planExpires?: string | null;  // Plan expiration date (ISO)
  planType?: string | null;     // Subscription plan type
  error?: string;               // Error message if not authenticated
}
```

Expiration is **soft**: `getAuthenticatedUser()` never rejects an expired account — it computes `isExpired` (SaaS mode only, non-beta accounts) and attaches it as metadata. This applies to account auth *and* PIN-based tokens whose family has a linked account. Enforcement happens via write protection (below). Closed accounts, by contrast, are hard-rejected with 401.

## Family-Level Authorization (The Golden Rule)

**Never trust client-sent family context.** The only source of truth for a user's family is `authContext.familyId` from the middleware.

Routes that accept an optional client-sent `familyId` (query param or body) resolve it through `resolveFamilyScope()` in `app/api/utils/family-scope.ts` rather than ad-hoc checks:

```typescript
const scope = resolveFamilyScope(authContext, requestedFamilyId);
if (!scope.ok) {
  return NextResponse.json({ success: false, error: scope.error }, { status: scope.status });
}
const targetFamilyId = scope.familyId;
```

For non-sysadmins the requested id may only *confirm* `authContext.familyId` — a mismatch returns 403, as does a missing family context. Sysadmins may target the requested family (cross-family access preserved). The setup-flow routes (`baby`, `caretaker`, `caretaker/system`, `settings`, `settings/verify-pin`) all use this helper.

### CRUD Authorization Patterns

**List (GET all):**
```typescript
const items = await prisma.feedLog.findMany({
  where: { familyId: userFamilyId, deletedAt: null }
});
```

**Read/Update/Delete (by ID):**
```typescript
const item = await prisma.feedLog.findUnique({ where: { id } });
if (!item || item.familyId !== userFamilyId) {
  return NextResponse.json({ success: false, error: 'Not found' }, { status: 404 });
}
```

**Create:**
```typescript
// Verify parent resource belongs to family
const baby = await prisma.baby.findFirst({
  where: { id: babyId, familyId: userFamilyId }
});
if (!baby) return NextResponse.json({ success: false, error: 'Baby not found' }, { status: 404 });

// Explicitly set familyId on new record
const log = await prisma.feedLog.create({
  data: { ...input, familyId: userFamilyId }
});
```

## System Administrator

System administrators authenticate with a sitewide admin password and get `isSysAdmin: true` in their JWT. They can operate on any family's data.

**Family context resolution for sysAdmin (in order):**
1. `?familyId=` query parameter
2. URL path slug → database lookup by slug
3. `Referer` header → extract slug → database lookup

## Write Protection (SaaS Mode)

Expired accounts get read-only access via `checkWritePermission()` in `app/api/utils/writeProtection.ts`:

```typescript
const writeCheck = checkWritePermission(authContext);
if (!writeCheck.allowed) return writeCheck.response;
```

- Only enforced when `DEPLOYMENT_MODE=saas` (auth only sets `isExpired` in SaaS mode)
- Returns 403 with a human-readable error message; the expiration type (`TRIAL_EXPIRED`, `PLAN_EXPIRED`, or `NO_PLAN`) and date are returned in `data.expirationInfo`
- Beta participants and non-account families are exempt

## IP Lockout

Brute-force protection via `app/api/utils/ip-lockout.ts`:
- In-memory store tracks failed login attempts per IP
- 3 failed attempts → 5-minute lockout
- `checkIpLockout(ip)` returns `{ locked, remainingTime }`
- `recordFailedAttempt(ip)` increments counter
- `resetFailedAttempts(ip)` clears on successful login

## Client-Side Auth Integration

The `FamilyProvider` (`src/context/family.tsx`) handles client-side auth:
- Global fetch interceptor adds `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to all requests
- 401 responses trigger automatic logout (except on login page)
- Account expiration checked every 30 seconds in SaaS mode (soft check reading the JWT payload — expired users are not logged out; the UI shows expiration banners while writes are blocked server-side)
- Provides `authenticatedFetch` wrapper for components

### Session handoff from the native app

When the app runs inside the Capacitor mobile shell there is a fourth way a
session can begin: the shell logs in against `/api/auth` or
`/api/accounts/login` itself, then navigates the WebView to the family page with
the resulting JWT in a `#bridge-session=` fragment.
`consumeInjectedSession()` (`src/utils/native-session.ts`) validates it, requires
the message's slug to match the current path, writes the same `localStorage` keys
the login screens write (`authToken`, `unlockTime`, `caretakerId`), and strips the
fragment immediately.

From the server's perspective nothing is special — it issued an ordinary token
through an ordinary login endpoint. The corollary is that **inside the shell the
web login UI must never render**: a family page that loads locked hands control
back to the shell instead (`src/utils/native-relock.ts`). See
[Native App Integration](./NativeAppIntegration.md).
