# Project Structure

## Overview

Sprout Track is a Next.js baby tracking application using the App Router. The codebase is organized into two main areas: `app/` for routing, pages, and API endpoints, and `src/` for shared components, hooks, context, and utilities. The application is deployed via Docker with SQLite as the default database; PostgreSQL is also supported (`docker-compose.postgres.yml`, `DATABASE_PROVIDER` env var), and all Prisma queries must be compatible with both.

## Route Groups

All authenticated routes use a `[slug]` dynamic segment for family scoping. The slug identifies which family's data to display.

### `(app)/[slug]/` — Main Application
The primary user experience after login:
- `page.tsx` — Dashboard home (daily stats, activity tiles, baby selector)
- `calendar/page.tsx` — Monthly calendar with activity indicators
- `full-log/page.tsx` — Complete activity timeline with filtering
- `log-entry/page.tsx` — Activity logging form
- `reports/page.tsx` — Reports and growth charts
- `layout.tsx` — App shell with side navigation, mobile menu, providers

### `(auth)/` — Authentication
- `login/page.tsx` — Login page (PIN-based or account-based)

### `(nursery)/[slug]/` — Nursery Mode
- `nursery-mode/page.tsx` — Simplified tablet interface for daycare/nursery use
- Separate layout optimized for wall-mounted tablets

### `(setup-resume)/[slug]/` — Setup Resume
- `resume-setup/page.tsx` — Resume a partially completed family setup

### Other Page Routes
- `account/` — Account management (family setup, payment success/cancelled)
- `family-manager/` — System admin interface for managing all families
- `family-select/` — Family selection (for users with access to multiple families)
- `setup/` — Token-based family setup (invited users)

## API Route Organization

API routes live under `app/api/` and are organized by domain. Each folder contains a `route.ts` file exporting named HTTP method handlers (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

### Core Domains
| Domain | Route Prefix | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Authentication | `/api/auth/` | Login, logout, token refresh, IP lockout |
| Accounts | `/api/accounts/` | Registration, verification, password management, payments |
| Family | `/api/family/` | Family CRUD, slug management, setup invites |
| Baby | `/api/baby/` | Baby CRUD, last activities, upcoming events |
| Caretaker | `/api/caretaker/` | Caretaker management, system caretaker |

### Activity Logging
| Route | Activity |
|-------|----------|
| `/api/sleep-log/` | Sleep and nap tracking |
| `/api/feed-log/` | Feeding (breast, bottle, solids) |
| `/api/diaper-log/` | Diaper changes |
| `/api/bath-log/` | Bath logging |
| `/api/play-log/` | Play and tummy time |
| `/api/pump-log/` | Breast pump sessions |
| `/api/measurement-log/` | Height, weight, temperature |
| `/api/medicine-log/` | Medicine administration |
| `/api/milestone-log/` | Developmental milestones |
| `/api/vaccine-log/` | Vaccine tracking with document uploads |

### Supporting APIs
| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/api/settings/` | Family settings, units, activity config |
| `/api/notifications/` | Push subscription, preferences, VAPID, native device tokens |
| `/api/calendar-event/` | Calendar events with recurrence |
| `/api/timeline/` | Aggregated activity timeline |
| `/api/localization/` | Language preferences |
| `/api/hooks/v1/` | External webhook API (Home Assistant) |
| `/api/database/` | Migration and backup management |

### Shared API Infrastructure
- `app/api/db.ts` — Prisma client singleton
- `app/api/types.ts` — Shared API type definitions
- `app/api/utils/` — Auth middleware, timezone, encryption, logging, and more

└── features/              # Feature-specific utilities (nursery-mode)
```

## Localization

All user-facing strings (including `aria-label`s) go through `t()` from the `useLocalization` hook (`@/src/context/localization`).

- `src/localization/translations/` — per-language JSON files (10 languages); flat key-value structure where keys are the exact English text and `en.json` is the fallback
- `src/localization/supported-languages.json` — supported language configuration
- `scripts/check-missing-translations.js` — adds missing keys to all non-English files and sorts them; run after adding keys to `en.json`

## Docker Deployment

The application runs in a Docker container built from `node:22-alpine`:

**Volumes:**
- `/db` — SQLite database files (persistent)
- `/app/env` — Environment configuration files
- `/app/Files` — Encrypted vaccine document storage

(`/app/logs` is created inside the image for notification logs but is not a mounted volume.)

**Key Environment Variables:**
- `DEPLOYMENT_MODE` — `saas` or `selfhosted` (code checks for `'saas'`)
- `JWT_SECRET` — JWT signing key
- `AUTH_LIFE` — Access token lifetime (seconds)
- `IDLE_TIME` — Client idle timeout (seconds)
- `ENABLE_NOTIFICATIONS` — Push notification feature flag
- `COOKIE_SECURE` — Secure cookie flag for HTTPS

**Startup:** `docker-startup.sh` runs Prisma migrations and starts the Next.js server.

## Key Files

- `app/layout.tsx` — Root layout with provider hierarchy
- `app/api/db.ts` — Prisma client singleton
- `app/api/utils/auth.ts` — Authentication middleware (see AuthenticationAndAuthorization.md)
- `prisma/schema.prisma` — Complete data model (see DataModel.md)
- `CLAUDE.md` — Development conventions and rules
- `tailwind.config.js` — Tailwind theme configuration (`darkMode: 'class'`)
