# Sprout Track -- Webhook API Documentation

**Version:** 1.1
**Base Path:** `/api/hooks/v1`

---

## Overview

The Sprout Track Webhook API allows external services to read and write baby activity data over HTTP. Any service that can make HTTP requests can integrate with it -- Home Assistant, Grafana, Node-RED, n8n, IFTTT, shell scripts, cron jobs, NFC automations, physical buttons, and more.

**Four verbs:**

- **GET** -- Poll Sprout Track for current state, recent activities, and reference data (dashboards, sensors, monitoring)
- **POST** -- Push new events into Sprout Track (physical buttons, automations, voice assistants)
- **PUT** -- Correct an existing record (fix an amount, adjust times)
- **DELETE** -- Remove a record logged in error

---

## Authentication

### API Keys

API keys are created and managed by caretakers with the **admin** role in the main app under **Settings > Admin > Integrations**. This is in the main Sprout Track interface, not the Family Manager.

Each key:
- Is scoped to a **family**
- Can optionally be restricted to a **specific baby**
- Has configurable **scopes** (`read`, `write`, or both)
- Can have an optional **expiration date**
- Can be **revoked** at any time

### Key Format

```
st_live_<random_hex_string>
```

Keys are shown **once** at creation time. They are stored as SHA-256 hashes and cannot be retrieved later.

### Usage

Include the key in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer st_live_your_key_here
```

### HTTPS Requirement

All API requests from public/external networks must use HTTPS. Plain HTTP is allowed from private and local network addresses:

- `localhost` / `127.0.0.0/8` (loopback)
- `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16` (RFC 1918 private networks)
- `169.254.0.0/16` (link-local)
- `::1`, `fc00::/7`, `fe80::/10` (IPv6 loopback, ULA, and link-local)

### Error Codes

| Code | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `HTTPS_REQUIRED` | 403 | Request must use HTTPS (except localhost) |
| `UNAUTHORIZED` | 401 | Missing or invalid Authorization header |
| `INVALID_KEY` | 401 | Key not found or wrong format |
| `KEY_REVOKED` | 401 | Key has been revoked |
| `KEY_EXPIRED` | 401 | Key has passed its expiration date |
| `INSUFFICIENT_SCOPE` | 403 | Key lacks the required scope (read or write) |
| `BABY_ACCESS_DENIED` | 403 | Key is restricted to a different baby |
| `BABY_NOT_FOUND` | 404 | Baby ID not found in this family |

---

## Rate Limiting

| Method | Limit |
|--------|-------|
| GET | 60 requests per minute per key |
| POST / PUT / DELETE | 30 requests per minute per key |

Every response includes rate limit headers:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 58
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1741789200
```

When exceeded, the API returns `429` with error code `RATE_LIMITED`.

### GET /babies/:babyId/status

Dashboard snapshot -- last activity per type, daily counts, and overdue warnings.

**Query Parameters:**

| Param | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `timezone` | server local | IANA timezone (e.g., `America/New_York`, `Europe/London`). Controls which calendar day is used for daily counts. Without this, the server's local timezone is used, which may not match yours. |

```bash
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer st_live_YOUR_KEY" \
  "http://localhost:3000/api/hooks/v1/babies/BABY_ID/status?timezone=America/Chicago"
```

**Response:**

```json

      "feedMinutesSinceWarning": null,
      "diaperOverdue": true,
      "diaperMinutesSinceWarning": 15
    }
  }
}
```

Each `lastActivities` field reflects the most recent record of that type (regardless of date) and is `null` if no record exists.

`activeFeed` reflects an in-progress breastfeeding timer session (started from the app or via the API) and is `null` when none is active. `leftDuration`/`rightDuration` are accrued seconds including time currently accruing on the active side.

```

---

### POST /babies/:babyId/activities

Create a new activity record.

**Common fields (all activity types):**

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `type` | Yes | Activity type (see below) |
| `time` | No | ISO 8601 timestamp, defaults to now |
| `caretakerName` | No | Matched against existing caretakers by name |

**Unknown fields are rejected.** Each activity type has a fixed set of accepted fields (documented per type below, plus the common fields above). Sending a field the type doesn't recognize returns `400 INVALID_FIELD` listing the offending field name(s), instead of silently accepting and dropping it. This also applies to `caretakerName`: a name that doesn't match any of the family's caretakers now returns `400 CARETAKER_NOT_FOUND` with the list of available caretaker names, rather than creating the activity unattributed.

**Common POST error codes (all activity types):**

| Code | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `INVALID_FIELD` | 400 | Body includes a field not accepted by the activity `type`, or a boolean field (`blowout`, `creamApplied`, `soapUsed`, `shampooUsed`) was sent as a non-boolean value |
| `CARETAKER_NOT_FOUND` | 400 | `caretakerName` was sent but doesn't match any caretaker in the family; the message lists available names |
| `INVALID_AMOUNT` | 400 | A numeric amount field (`amount`, `leftAmount`, `rightAmount`, `totalAmount`) is non-numeric, or a required amount (medicine/supplement `amount`) is missing/null |
| `INVALID_UNIT` | 400 | `unitAbbr` (feed, pump, medicine, supplement) doesn't match any unit configured for your family; the message lists available `unitAbbr` values. Matching is case-insensitive — `"oz"` resolves to the stored `"OZ"` |

**Validated enum-like fields:** `diaper.condition`, `diaper.color`, `sleep.quality`, `feed.bottleType`, and `feed.side` are matched case-insensitively against a canonical set and stored using that set's exact casing — sending `"loose"` stores `"LOOSE"`. An unrecognized value returns `400` naming the field's error code (`INVALID_CONDITION`, `INVALID_COLOR`, `INVALID_QUALITY`, `INVALID_BOTTLE_TYPE`, `INVALID_SIDE`) with the valid values listed. `bath.bathType` is normalized the same way for its known values, but an unrecognized `bathType` is accepted verbatim rather than rejected — the app supports free-text custom bath types. Use `GET /reference` (below) to discover every one of these sets, plus the family's configured units, ahead of time.

#### Feed

```json
{
  "type": "feed",
  "feedType": "formula",
  "amount": 4,
  "unitAbbr": "OZ"
}
```

**feedType values:**

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `BREAST` | Breastfeeding |
| `BOTTLE` | Bottle (set `bottleType` separately) |
| `SOLIDS` | Solid food |
| `formula` | Auto-sets BOTTLE + bottleType "Formula" |
| `breast milk` | Auto-sets BOTTLE + bottleType "Breast Milk" |
| `milk` | Auto-sets BOTTLE + bottleType "Milk" |
| `other` | Auto-sets BOTTLE + bottleType "Other" |

Optional fields: `amount`, `unitAbbr`, `side`, `food`, `notes`, `bottleType`

`amount` distinguishes an explicit `0` (stored as `0`) from an omitted value (stored as `null`). A non-numeric `amount` returns `400 INVALID_AMOUNT`.

**`side` values:** `LEFT`, `RIGHT` (case-insensitive; stored as the exact uppercase token). An unrecognized value returns `400 INVALID_SIDE`.

**`bottleType` values:** `Formula`, `Breast Milk`, `Formula/Breast`, `Milk`, `Other` (case-insensitive; stored using this exact casing). An unrecognized value returns `400 INVALID_BOTTLE_TYPE`.

`unitAbbr` is matched case-insensitively against your family's configured units (see `GET /reference?type=units`) and stored using that table's exact casing (e.g. `"oz"` is accepted and stored as `"OZ"`). An unrecognized value returns `400 INVALID_UNIT` listing the units actually configured.

**Log a completed breastfeed with known duration:**
```json
{
  "type": "feed",
  "feedType": "BREAST",
  "side": "LEFT",
  "duration": 15
}
```

`duration` is in minutes (matching sleep and pump). The entry is created with `startTime = time`, `endTime = time + duration`, and `feedDuration` (seconds), so it appears as a timed feed in the app.

##### Breastfeeding timer (start/stop)

Breastfeeds also support timer actions backed by the same live session as the in-app timer — a feed started via the API shows as active in the app (and vice versa), and can be controlled from either surface.

**Start a session (requires `side`):**
```json
{
  "type": "feed",
  "feedType": "BREAST",
  "action": "start",
  "side": "LEFT"
}
```

**Switch sides / pause / resume the active session:**
```json
{ "type": "feed", "feedType": "BREAST", "action": "switch" }
{ "type": "feed", "feedType": "BREAST", "action": "pause" }
{ "type": "feed", "feedType": "BREAST", "action": "resume", "side": "RIGHT" }
```

`resume` optionally accepts a `side`; without it the previously active side resumes.

**End the session:**
```json
{
  "type": "feed",
  "feedType": "BREAST",
  "action": "end"
}
```

Ending creates one `FeedLog` per side that accrued time, linked by a shared `sessionId` so they count as one nursing session, and returns the created log ids and durations. The rows carry real sequential spans: the side used first starts at the session start, and the other side starts where the first ended plus any paused time, so each row's `startTime`/`endTime`/`feedDuration` (seconds) reflects when that side was actually in use. Each row also records `pauseDuration` -- the session's total paused seconds (same value on both rows; `null` on records created before this field existed).

**action:** `start`, `switch`, `pause`, `resume`, `end`, or `log` (default when omitted)

Timer action responses include the live session state: `activeSide`, `isPaused`, `leftDuration`/`rightDuration` (seconds), and `isActive`.

**Feed-specific error codes:**

| Code | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `INVALID_ACTION` | 400 | Unknown action, or a timer action used with a non-BREAST feedType |
| `SIDE_REQUIRED` | 400 | `action: "start"` without a LEFT/RIGHT side |
| `FEED_ALREADY_ACTIVE` | 409 | `start` while a session is already active for this baby |
| `NO_ACTIVE_FEED` | 400 | `switch`/`pause`/`resume`/`end` with no active session |
| `INVALID_DURATION` | 400 | `duration` is not a positive number of minutes |

#### Diaper

```json
{
  "type": "diaper",
  "diaperType": "WET",
  "notes": "Slight rash"
}
```

**diaperType:** `WET`, `DIRTY`, `BOTH`, or `DRY` (`DRY` records a change with no contents)

Optional fields: `condition`, `color`, `blowout` (boolean), `creamApplied` (boolean), `notes`

`blowout` and `creamApplied` both default to `false` when omitted. If sent, the value must be a real JSON boolean (`true`/`false`) — a truthy-but-not-boolean value (e.g. the string `"true"`, `1`) returns `400`. `creamApplied` is also included in the `GET /activities` response for diaper entries.

**`condition` values:** `NORMAL`, `LOOSE`, `FIRM`, `OTHER` (case-insensitive; stored using this exact casing — sending `"loose"` stores `"LOOSE"`). An unrecognized value returns `400 INVALID_CONDITION`.

**`color` values:** `YELLOW`, `BROWN`, `GREEN`, `BLACK`, `RED`, `OTHER` (case-insensitive; stored using this exact casing). An unrecognized value returns `400 INVALID_COLOR`.

#### Sleep

Sleep supports three actions:

**Start a sleep session:**
```json
{
  "type": "sleep",
  "sleepType": "NAP",
  "action": "start",
  "location": "Crib"
}
```

**End the most recent active sleep:**
```json
{
  "type": "sleep",
  "action": "end"
}
```

**End and change the sleep type (e.g., a nap that became a night sleep):**
```json
{
  "type": "sleep",
  "sleepType": "NIGHT_SLEEP",
  "action": "end"
}
```

**Log a completed sleep with known duration:**
```json
{
  "type": "sleep",
  "sleepType": "NAP",
  "action": "log",
  "duration": 45,
  "location": "Crib",
  "notes": "Slept peacefully"
}
```

**sleepType:** `NAP` or `NIGHT_SLEEP` -- required for `start` and `log`, optional for `end`
**action:** `start`, `end`, or `log`
Optional fields: `location`, `quality`, `duration` (minutes, required for `log`), `notes`

**`quality` values:** `POOR`, `FAIR`, `GOOD`, `EXCELLENT` (case-insensitive; stored using this exact casing). An unrecognized value returns `400 INVALID_QUALITY`.

> **Note:** If `sleepType` is provided on `end`, the sleep record's type is updated. If omitted, the type from `start` is preserved.

#### Note

```json
{
  "type": "note",
  "content": "First smile today!",
  "category": "milestone"
}
```

`content` is required. `category` is optional.

#### Pump

Pump uses the same start/end/log pattern as sleep:

```json
{ "type": "pump", "action": "start" }
```
```json
{ "type": "pump", "action": "end", "leftAmount": 3, "rightAmount": 2, "unitAbbr": "OZ" }
```
```json
{ "type": "pump", "action": "log", "duration": 20, "leftAmount": 3, "rightAmount": 2, "unitAbbr": "OZ" }
```

Optional fields: `leftAmount`, `rightAmount`, `totalAmount`, `unitAbbr`, `pumpAction` (`STORED`, `FED`, or `DISCARDED`; case-insensitive, default `STORED`; an unrecognized value returns `400 INVALID_PUMP_ACTION`)

`totalAmount` is a writable field, not just a derived one: send it alone (without `leftAmount`/`rightAmount`) to record a total without attributing it to either side. If `totalAmount` and one or both sides are sent together, the explicit `totalAmount` wins over the sum of the sides. If only `leftAmount`/`rightAmount` are sent, `totalAmount` is derived as their sum. Explicit `0` on `leftAmount`/`rightAmount`/`totalAmount` is stored as `0` (a genuine empty pump), distinct from omitting the field entirely (stored as `null`, unknown).

`unitAbbr` is matched case-insensitively against your family's configured units and stored using that table's exact casing. An unrecognized value returns `400 INVALID_UNIT` listing the units actually configured.

#### Bath

```json
{
  "type": "bath",
  "bathType": "Sponge Bath",
  "soapUsed": true,
  "shampooUsed": false,
  "notes": "Quick sponge bath"
}
```

All fields optional. `soapUsed` and `shampooUsed` default to `true` when omitted (this is an existing quirk of the underlying schema default, not a new behavior). If either field is sent, it must be a real JSON boolean — a non-boolean value (e.g. the string `"false"`) returns `400`, rather than being silently coerced. `bathType`'s known values (`Full Bath`, `Sponge Bath`, `Wipe Down`) are matched case-insensitively and stored using this exact casing — sending `"sponge bath"` stores `"Sponge Bath"`. Any other value is accepted and stored verbatim, since the app also supports free-text custom bath types.

#### Measurement

```json
{
  "type": "measurement",
  "measurementType": "WEIGHT",
  "value": 18.5,
  "unit": "LB"
}
```

**measurementType:** `WEIGHT`, `HEIGHT`, `HEAD_CIRCUMFERENCE`, or `TEMPERATURE`
`value` is required and must be a finite number (a missing/null `value` returns `400 VALUE_REQUIRED`; a non-numeric `value` returns `400 INVALID_VALUE`). `unit` is optional. `caretakerName`, if provided and resolved, is now attributed to the created measurement and echoed back by `GET /activities` (previously the caretaker link was accepted but silently discarded).

#### Medicine

```json
{
  "type": "medicine",
  "medicineName": "Vitamin D Drops",
  "amount": 1,
  "unitAbbr": "ML"
}
```

`medicineName` must match an active medicine configured for your family. If not found, the error response lists available medicines. Use the reference endpoint to look them up first.

`amount` is required and must be a finite number — a missing, `null`, or non-numeric `amount` returns `400 INVALID_AMOUNT` rather than silently recording a dose of `0` (the underlying `doseAmount` column cannot be null, so previously an omitted amount fabricated a real zero-dose record).

Optional fields: `unitAbbr`, `notes` — `notes` is now persisted and returned by `GET /activities` (previously accepted but silently dropped). If omitted, `unitAbbr` falls back to the medicine's configured unit. `unitAbbr`, when sent, is matched case-insensitively against your family's configured units and stored using that table's exact casing; an unrecognized value returns `400 INVALID_UNIT` listing the units actually configured.

#### Supplement

```json
{
  "type": "supplement",
  "supplementName": "Vitamin D Drops",
  "amount": 1,
  "unitAbbr": "ML"
}
```

`supplementName` must match an active supplement configured for your family. If not found, the error response lists available supplements. Use the reference endpoint (`?type=supplements`) to look them up first.

`amount` is required and must be a finite number — a missing, `null`, or non-numeric `amount` returns `400 INVALID_AMOUNT` rather than silently recording a dose of `0` (the underlying `doseAmount` column cannot be null, so previously an omitted amount fabricated a real zero-dose record).

Optional fields: `unitAbbr`, `notes` — `notes` is now persisted and returned by `GET /activities` (previously accepted but silently dropped). If omitted, `unitAbbr` falls back to the medicine's configured unit. `unitAbbr`, when sent, is matched case-insensitively against your family's configured units and stored using that table's exact casing; an unrecognized value returns `400 INVALID_UNIT` listing the units actually configured.

#### Play

```json
{
  "type": "play",
  "playType": "TUMMY_TIME",
  "duration": 15,
  "notes": "Really enjoyed it today"
}
```

**playType:** `TUMMY_TIME`, `INDOOR_PLAY`, `OUTDOOR_PLAY`, `WALK`, or `CUSTOM`
Optional fields: `duration` (minutes), `notes`, `activities` (sub-category string)

---

### PUT /babies/:babyId/activities/:activityId

Edit an existing activity record through API-key auth.

`type` is required in the JSON body so the hooks route can validate fields against the correct activity model. Only fields valid for that activity type are accepted; `familyId`, `babyId`, and `caretakerId` cannot be reassigned through this endpoint.

The same enum-like field validation and normalization described under `POST /activities` above applies here: `condition`, `color`, `quality`, `bottleType`, `side`, and `unitAbbr` are validated and normalized to their canonical casing on update too, with the same error codes.

For `sleep`, sending `endTime` without `duration` recomputes `duration` (whole minutes) from the effective start time (the `startTime` in the same request, or the record's existing `startTime` otherwise); an `endTime` before that start returns `400`, and an explicit `duration` in the request always takes precedence over the recompute.

For `medicine`/`supplement`, an explicit `null` for `amount` or `doseAmount` returns `400` rather than silently recording a zero dose (the underlying `doseAmount` column cannot be null).

For `feed`, `duration` (or `feedDuration`) is in minutes, matching POST -- it is stored as `feedDuration` in seconds.

**PUT error codes:**

| Code | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `INVALID_ROUTE` | 400 | Missing `babyId`/`activityId` in the path |
| `INVALID_JSON` | 400 | Body is not a JSON object |
| `INVALID_ACTIVITY_TYPE` | 400 | `type` missing or not one of the ten supported types |
| `INVALID_FIELD` | 400 | Body includes a field the declared `type` doesn't accept |
| `ACTIVITY_NOT_FOUND` | 404 | No matching, non-deleted activity of that type for this baby and family |
| `INVALID_UPDATE` | 400 | A field failed validation (the message names the field), or no mutable field was sent |

```bash
curl -s -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer st_live_YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"feed","amount":3,"unitAbbr":"OZ","notes":"Corrected amount"}' \
  http://localhost:3000/api/hooks/v1/babies/BABY_ID/activities/ACTIVITY_ID
```

**Supported types:** `feed`, `diaper`, `sleep`, `note`, `pump`, `play`, `bath`, `measurement`, `medicine`, and `supplement`.

The response includes `activityType`, `id`, `babyId`, `time` when applicable, `status: "updated"`, and type-specific confirmation details.

### DELETE /babies/:babyId/activities/:activityId

Delete an existing activity record through API-key auth.

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer st_live_YOUR_KEY" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/hooks/v1/babies/BABY_ID/activities/ACTIVITY_ID
```

The hooks delete endpoint matches the current classic UI log behavior for these activity types: after confirming the row belongs to the API key's family and route baby, it hard-deletes the activity row. Add `?type=feed` if you already know the activity type and want to avoid type probing -- `?type=` accepts the same ten activity type values as PUT. DELETE shares the 30 requests/minute write rate limit.

The response includes `activityType`, `id`, `babyId`, `time` when applicable, and `status: "deleted"`.

---

### GET /babies/:babyId/measurements/latest

Returns the most recent measurement of each type.

```bash

### GET /babies/:babyId/reference

Returns valid values for use with POST endpoints. Use this to discover medicines, sleep locations, play categories, feed types, the enum-like field values validated by POST/PUT, and the family's configured units before creating activities.

**Query Parameters:**

| Param | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `type` | all | `medicines`, `supplements`, `sleep-locations`, `play-categories`, `feed-types`, `diaper-conditions`, `diaper-colors`, `sleep-qualities`, `bath-types`, or `units` |
| `playType` | -- | Filter play categories by play type |

```bash
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer st_live_YOUR_KEY" \
  "http://localhost:3000/api/hooks/v1/babies/BABY_ID/reference?type=medicines"
```

**Response (all types):**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "medicines": [
      { "id": "...", "name": "Infant Tylenol", "typicalDoseSize": 1.25, "unitAbbr": "ML", "isSupplement": false }
    ],
    "supplements": [
      { "id": "...", "name": "Vitamin D Drops", "typicalDoseSize": 1, "unitAbbr": "ML", "isSupplement": true }
    ],
    "sleepLocations": ["Bassinet", "Stroller", "Crib", "Car Seat", "Parents Room", "Contact", "Other"],
    "playCategories": ["Blocks", "Reading", "Sensory Play"],
    "feedTypes": [
      { "value": "BREAST", "description": "Breastfeeding" },
      { "value": "BOTTLE", "description": "Bottle (specify bottleType separately)" },
      { "value": "SOLIDS", "description": "Solid food" },
      { "value": "formula", "description": "Formula bottle (auto-sets BOTTLE + formula)" },
      { "value": "breast milk", "description": "Pumped breast milk bottle" },
      { "value": "milk", "description": "Milk bottle" },
      { "value": "other", "description": "Other bottle type" }
    ],
    "diaperConditions": ["NORMAL", "LOOSE", "FIRM", "OTHER"],
    "diaperColors": ["YELLOW", "BROWN", "GREEN", "BLACK", "RED", "OTHER"],
    "sleepQualities": ["POOR", "FAIR", "GOOD", "EXCELLENT"],
    "bathTypes": ["Full Bath", "Sponge Bath", "Wipe Down"],
    "units": [
      { "unitAbbr": "ML", "unitName": "Milliliters" },
      { "unitAbbr": "OZ", "unitName": "Ounces" }
    ]
  }
}
```

`sleepLocations` is deduplicated ignoring case and underscore/space differences, preferring the display-cased variant (e.g. a legacy `CAR_SEAT` value logged before validation existed collapses onto `Car Seat` rather than appearing as a separate duplicate entry). `units` lists every unit configured in the `Unit` table and is the same set `unitAbbr` is validated against on POST/PUT.

## Sample Scenarios

### 1. Home Assistant -- Baby Status Sensors

Poll the status endpoint to create sensors for feed time, diaper count, and sleep state.

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
rest:
  - resource: "http://sprout-track:3000/api/hooks/v1/babies/BABY_ID/status?timezone=America/Chicago"
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer st_live_YOUR_KEY"
    scan_interval: 60
    sensor:
      - name: "Baby Last Feed"
        value_template: "{{ value_json.data.lastActivities.feed.minutesAgo | default('N/A') }}"
        unit_of_measurement: "min ago"
      - name: "Baby Feed Count Today"
        value_template: "{{ value_json.data.dailyCounts.feeds }}"
      - name: "Baby Diaper Count Today"
        value_template: "{{ value_json.data.dailyCounts.diapers }}"
      - name: "Baby Sleep Minutes Today"
        value_template: "{{ value_json.data.dailyCounts.sleepMinutes }}"
        unit_of_measurement: "min"
      - name: "Baby Feed Overdue"
        value_template: "{{ value_json.data.warnings.feedOverdue }}"
```

### 2. Home Assistant -- Button to Log Formula Feed

Use a physical Zigbee button or dashboard button to log a 4oz formula bottle with one press.

```yaml
# automations.yaml
- alias: "Nursery Button - Log Formula"
  trigger:
    - platform: device
      device_id: nursery_button
      type: action
      subtype: single
  action:
    - service: rest_command.log_formula
      data: {}

# configuration.yaml
rest_command:
  log_formula:
    url: "http://sprout-track:3000/api/hooks/v1/babies/BABY_ID/activities"
    method: POST
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer st_live_YOUR_KEY"
      Content-Type: "application/json"
    payload: '{"type":"feed","feedType":"formula","amount":4,"unitAbbr":"OZ"}'
```

### 3. NFC Tag -- Quick Diaper Log

Tap an NFC tag on the changing table to log a wet diaper. Works with iOS Shortcuts or Android Tasker.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer st_live_YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"diaper","diaperType":"WET"}' \
  http://sprout-track:3000/api/hooks/v1/babies/BABY_ID/activities
```

### 4. Cron Job -- Daily Summary Script

Run a nightly script that fetches the day's activity counts and sends a summary.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# daily-summary.sh -- run via cron at 9pm

API_KEY="st_live_YOUR_KEY"
BASE="http://sprout-track:3000/api/hooks/v1"
BABY_ID="YOUR_BABY_ID"
TIMEZONE="America/Chicago"

STATUS=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" "$BASE/babies/$BABY_ID/status?timezone=$TIMEZONE")

FEEDS=$(echo "$STATUS" | jq '.data.dailyCounts.feeds')
DIAPERS=$(echo "$STATUS" | jq '.data.dailyCounts.diapers')
SLEEP=$(echo "$STATUS" | jq '.data.dailyCounts.sleepMinutes')
NAPS=$(echo "$STATUS" | jq '.data.dailyCounts.naps')

echo "Daily Summary:"
echo "  Feeds: $FEEDS"
echo "  Diapers: $DIAPERS"
echo "  Sleep: ${SLEEP}min across $NAPS naps"
```

### 5. Grafana Dashboard

Use Grafana's JSON API data source to poll feed and diaper activity over time.

```
GET /api/hooks/v1/babies/BABY_ID/activities?type=feed&limit=50&since=2026-03-05T00:00:00Z
GET /api/hooks/v1/babies/BABY_ID/activities?type=diaper&limit=50&since=2026-03-05T00:00:00Z
```

Each response includes timestamped records that can be plotted on time-series panels.

### 6. Automation -- Feed Overdue Alert

Poll the status endpoint and send a notification when the feed warning triggers.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# check-feed.sh -- run every 5 minutes via cron

API_KEY="st_live_YOUR_KEY"
BASE="http://sprout-track:3000/api/hooks/v1"
BABY_ID="YOUR_BABY_ID"
TIMEZONE="America/Chicago"

STATUS=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" "$BASE/babies/$BABY_ID/status?timezone=$TIMEZONE")
OVERDUE=$(echo "$STATUS" | jq -r '.data.warnings.feedOverdue')

if [ "$OVERDUE" = "true" ]; then
  MINUTES=$(echo "$STATUS" | jq '.data.warnings.feedMinutesSinceWarning')
  # Send notification via your preferred method
  curl -X POST "https://ntfy.sh/your-topic" \
    -d "Feed overdue by ${MINUTES} minutes!"
fi
```

### 7. Sleep Tracking with Start/End

Use two buttons or automations -- one to start, one to end a nap.

**Start nap (when baby goes down):**
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer st_live_YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"sleep","sleepType":"NAP","action":"start","location":"Crib"}' \
  http://sprout-track:3000/api/hooks/v1/babies/BABY_ID/activities
```

**End nap (when baby wakes):**
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer st_live_YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"sleep","sleepType":"NAP","action":"end"}' \
  http://sprout-track:3000/api/hooks/v1/babies/BABY_ID/activities
```

The API automatically calculates the duration.

### 8. Medicine & Supplement Administration with Lookup

Medicines and supplements are separate types. Use the reference endpoint to discover what's available, then log a dose.

**Look up medicines:**
```bash
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer st_live_YOUR_KEY" \
  "http://sprout-track:3000/api/hooks/v1/babies/BABY_ID/reference?type=medicines"
```

**Log a medicine dose:**
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer st_live_YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"medicine","medicineName":"Infant Tylenol","amount":1.25,"unitAbbr":"ML"}' \
  http://sprout-track:3000/api/hooks/v1/babies/BABY_ID/activities
```

**Look up supplements:**
```bash
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer st_live_YOUR_KEY" \
  "http://sprout-track:3000/api/hooks/v1/babies/BABY_ID/reference?type=supplements"
```

**Log a supplement dose:**
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer st_live_YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"supplement","supplementName":"Vitamin D Drops","amount":1,"unitAbbr":"ML"}' \
  http://sprout-track:3000/api/hooks/v1/babies/BABY_ID/activities
```

## Testing

An interactive test script is included:

```bash
node scripts/test-webhook-api.js
node scripts/test-webhook-api.js --read-only
node scripts/test-webhook-api.js --write-only
```

The script prompts for your base URL and API key, then runs auth, read, and write tests against a live instance.
